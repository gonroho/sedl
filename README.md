# SEDL
SEDL (Scientific Experiments Description Language) is a language for describing scientific experiments. The aim of SEDL is to support the creation of accurate and unambiguous descriptions, independently of any tool or publication organization. 

SEDL documents include information that experimental description should provide regardless of the domain or scientific area  of the experiment, namely: experimental objects, subjects, population, variables and their corresponding domains or levels, hypotheses, treatments and subdivision in groups, and analysis to be performed on experiment data.

Another important feature is that SEDL allows for the creation of other internal DSLs for defining details for a specific domain or scientific area, since it has a set of extension points.
