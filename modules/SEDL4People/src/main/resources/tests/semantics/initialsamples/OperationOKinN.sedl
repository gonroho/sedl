EXPERIMENT:myExperiment version:1.0

Variables:
Factors:    // Please, change the values, domain and add the factors of your experiemnt
    var1 enum "1","6","20"
    var2 enum "3","4","30"
Outcome:
   outcome in N // You should change the name of the outcomen variable to

Hypothesis: Differential    // By default we assume a differential hypothesis, meaning
                            // that the value of var1 has a significant effect on the
                            // value of outome, i.e. it makes a difference.

Design:
 Sampling: Random   
 Groups: by var1 sizing 50
 Protocol: Random
 Analyses:                  // By default we provide two set of analyses:
    DescriptiveStatitics:   //   descriptive statistics about the results:
        Avg()
        Median()
        StdDev()
    NHST:                   //  and a minimimal parametric test of hypothesis:
        ANOVA(,)
