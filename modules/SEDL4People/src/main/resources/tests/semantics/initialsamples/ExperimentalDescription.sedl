Variables:
Factors:    // Please, change the values, domain and add the factors of your experiemnt
    var1 enum 10,30,60,81,65,10,30,60,81,65
    var2 enum 19,20,30,84,56,19,20,30,84,56
Outcome:
   outcome in R  // You should change the name of the outcomen variable to

Hypothesis: Differential    // By default we assume a differential hypothesis, meaning
                            // that the value of var1 has a significant effect on the
                            // value of outome, i.e. it makes a difference.

Design:
 Sampling: Random   
 Groups: by var1 sizing 30
 Protocol: Random
 Analyses:                  // By default we provide two set of analyses:
    DescriptiveStatitics:   //   descriptive statistics about the results:
        Range(var1)
        Range(var1,var2)
        Range(of var1 where var1 by var2)
