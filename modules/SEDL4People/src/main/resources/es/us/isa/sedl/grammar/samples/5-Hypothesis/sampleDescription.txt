A scientific hypothesis is a testable assertion. We distinguish three different types of hypotheses: descriptive, associational, and differential. 

The type of hypothesis of a SEDL experiment is specified either with a keyword indicating whether the hypothesis is differential, associational or descriptive, or stating the hypothesis explicitly (see examples).
If the hypothesis is differential, it is assumed that the goal of the experiment is to confirm or disprove that the values of the controllable factors make a difference in the outcome. 
Associational hypotheses are intended to confirm or disprove that the relationship between the controllable factor and the outcomes follows a specific mathematical relation. 
Finally, descriptive hypotheses state that the value of the outcome has certain statistical properties.
