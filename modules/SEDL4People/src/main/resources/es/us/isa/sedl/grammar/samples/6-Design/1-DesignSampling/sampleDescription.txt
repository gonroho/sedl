The sampling method describes how the experimental individuals used in our experiment are
 chosen from the accesible population of individuals. It contains a boolean attribute, named
 random that specifies the randomness of determinism of the selection procedure. Additionally,
 the specific procedure used for sampling can be described using the description element.		
 
 The supported sampling methods are random, random block and custom. If the sampling 
method is random the objects are randomly selected from the population. If the
sampling method is random block, the objects are randomly picked from the population 
and assigned to the blocks until all blocks are complete. The number of blocks depends 
on the non controllable factors used for blocking in the assignments. 
Finally, custom samplings methods are also allowed using the extensions points of 
the language. 

The assignment method describes how the individuals in the population of the experiment are associated to the groups. The use of a random assignment 
 method is necessary for having an experiment, otherwise, we have a quasy-experiment. With quasi-experimental studies, it may not be possible to 
 demonstrate a causal link between the treatment condition and observed outcomes. On the other hand,  With random assignment, experimental subjects have the same 
 chance of being assigned to any group. As a result, all the groups will be statistically identical to the control group, on both controlled and
 uncontrolled variables, at baseline (provided that the study has adequate sample size).
 In SEDL assignment methods have a boolean attribute that describes if the assignment is random or not, and a description of the specic procedure used
 for assignment (as a string in natural language).
 
  A group is a set of experimental individuals that receive a sequence of treatments and 
 whose values for the dependent variables are measured in a specific sequence.
