Configurations may include a set of so-called runs. A run represents a conduction of the experiment 
using an specific configuration. Note that this is primordial to make experiments self-contained and to 
enable the comparison of results in subsequent replications. An experimental run is described in terms of 
the result dataset and the results of the analyses. Accordingly to the described in the previous section, 
the results can be either of descriptive statistics or results of statistical tests.
