If a factor is of no particular interest in an experiment, 
but could be useful in subsequent replications or its impact on the response is unknown,
 it is called a extraneous variable (a.k.a. nuisance variable). 
Extraneous variables must be ruled out or controlled in order to ensure the 
validity of the experiment.
