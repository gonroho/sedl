
A configuration is a description of the specific factors affecting a set of experimental 
executions, along with the specific details about how will be provided
 the inputs	and outputs of the experiment in that specific context. By dividing the set of 
 factors affecting an experiment in design and configuration, we aim to maintain a general and
  unique experiment design among experimental replications. 
 In this sense, the experimental desigh should remain valid and consistent among replications in 
 order to allow the comparison of results and the identification of relevant variables
in the context of the variable by comparing the results of multiple executions with different 
configurations.
Additionally, the configuration can contain two optional elements: the experimental procedure, 
that especifies how the experiment should be conducted in the specific environment of the 
configuration, and a context of the configuration (since each replication of the experiment
could be performed by different experimenters in different organizations).
