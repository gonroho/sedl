/**
 This sample specifies a structured experimental conduction procedure where a 
    domain-specific global preprocessing step is performed before starting
    the experimental conduction(missing data sustitution), and two preprocessing
    steps are performed prior to each treatment application (attributeDiscretization
    and training). This sample assumes that the data mining module has been
    imported (DM).

Procedure:
        Preprocessing:
            // Before starting the conduction we sustitute missing data with the
            // mean value of the classification (mode if the dataset classification 
            // attribute is nominal).
            Command as DM::{MissingDataSustitution for missing,undefined,null 
                            with Mean(dataset.classificationAttribute)}(dataset): ""			
            // Before each treatment we discretize and train:
