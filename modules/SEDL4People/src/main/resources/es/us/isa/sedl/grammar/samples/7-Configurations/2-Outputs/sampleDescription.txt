Experimental Outputs are a description of the expected output of the experiment. It contains a set of output data sources.

 The ouputDatasource type is an element that denotes individual output item for the experiment.
 It has been declared abstract to emphasize that it is an extension point, that must be used to define concrete types of 
 output datasources. SEDL 1.0 provides a single types of specific  output datasource: the  outputFiles element.
