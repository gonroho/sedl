SEDL supports the specification of two types of statistical analyses on experimental datasets, descriptive statistics and statistical analyses.

Regarding descriptive statistics, SEDL supports the specification of measures including mean, median, mode,
standard deviation, range, inter-quartile range, and confi- dence intervals.
And also rankings, which establish an order relation on the levels of a set of factors based on the value of a descriptive statistic, e.g. mean.
