Experimental Inputs are a description of the input data required for the execution of the experiment
in the specific configuration. This description could be used to test the replicability of the experiment
 in an specific environment, by checking the availability of those inputs. Currently it is composed of a set of inputDataSources. 

The inputDatasource type is an element that denotes individual inputs for the experiment. 
It has bee declared abstract to emphasize that it is an extension point, that must be used to define concrete 
types of input datasources. SEDL 1.0 provides two different types of input datasources: files and URLs.        				 				  				 
Since input datasources can be associated to specific levels of some variables it can contain an arbitrary 
sequence of variable valuations.

This extension point enables the use of alternative sources of input data for experiments such as public online datasets or experimental repositories
