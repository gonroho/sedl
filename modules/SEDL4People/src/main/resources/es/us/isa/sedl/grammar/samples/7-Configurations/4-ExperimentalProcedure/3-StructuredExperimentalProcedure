/**
    This sample shows an experimental procedure described in its structured form.
    In this case all the commands to be executed as, preprocessing, execution 
    and postprocessing are described.
    Additionally, a preTreatment preprocessing command is described.
**/
Procedure:
    Preprocessing:
        Command(dataset): "cleanDataset $dataset.filename" // First we clean the dataset
        // Just beform applying the treament with the algorithm and evaluation fold,
        // we train the corresponding algorithm with the training folds.
        Command as Pretreatment Preprocessing(algorithm,trainingFold): "$algorithm.trainingCommand $evaluationFold.fileName $algorithm.trainingConfigFile"
    Execution:		
        // We apply the treatment by applying the algoritms on the evaluation fold.
	Command as Treatment(algorithm,evaluationFold): "$algorithm.command $evaluationFold.fileName"
    Postprocessing:
        // Finally we compute average results per algorithm and dataset.
        Command: "computeAverages globalResults.csv averageResults.csv"
