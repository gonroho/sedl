The datasets on which the analyses should be performed are specified in terms of three different operations:

Projection (OF): A projection defines the set of variable measurements that a dataset will contain. 
It is similar to the enumeration of columns after the SELECT in SQL queries. 
When a single outcome variable is specified in the experiment, a projection by this variable is implicitly assumed. 

Filtering (WHERE): This operation selects a subset of the results dataset based on the values of specific variables, in a very similar way as the WHERE clause in SQL. 

Grouping (BY): Grouping operations define how the elements in different datasets will be arranged for comparison in statistical tests. 
Its primary use is the specification of the blocks defined by blocking variables. 

These operations can be nested following the order if this description: OF, WHERE, BY
