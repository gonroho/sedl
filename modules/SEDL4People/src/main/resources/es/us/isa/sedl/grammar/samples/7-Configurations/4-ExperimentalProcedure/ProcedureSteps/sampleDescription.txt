An experimental tasks is a simple step of a sequential experimental procedure. 
Experimental tasks are an  extension point of SEDL. In this sense, if no
control flow or decision making structures are needed during the conduction of the experiments, 
an execution scheme can be use to describe the experimental procedure, and user defined tasks can 
be used to provide the information needed for a accurate and replicable experimental conduction description.

A command is a experimental task that specifies a command to be executed in a OS shell. 
A command has a name, a set of arguments, and an optional path where it will be executed.
