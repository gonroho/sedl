The protocol establishes the order in which the individual objects receives the treatments. 
The experimental protocols supported in SEDL are random and custom. 
Custom protocols can be defined using the extension points of the language.

An experimental protocol describes  the sequences of treatments  and measurements
to be performed on the different groups of the experiment. It is comprises of a se of steps, that can be
either measurements or treatments.
A protocol step type makes reference to a set of groups where it is applied. If no group is specified, 
It is assumed that the step is performed on all the groups of the experiment.

We support two different ways of specifying the experimental design: using a predefined experiment design (among a set of classical examples such as 
Factorials, Latin Squares, Hyper-latin cubes, etc.), or defining a custom design.

The assignment method describes how the individuals in the population of the experiment are associated to the groups. The use of a random assignment 
 method is necessary for having an experiment, otherwise, we have a quasy-experiment. With quasi-experimental studies, it may not be possible to 
 demonstrate a causal link between the treatment condition and observed outcomes. On the other hand,  With random assignment, experimental subjects have the same 
 chance of being assigned to any group. As a result, all the groups will be statistically identical to the control group, on both controlled and
 uncontrolled variables, at baseline (provided that the study has adequate sample size).
 In SEDL assignment methods have a boolean attribute that describes if the assignment is random or not, and a description of the specic procedure used
 for assignment (as a string in natural language).
